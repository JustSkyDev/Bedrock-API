<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<br />

## About The Project

JSBedrock-API will provide you with a lot of classes and methods for you to use. There be a lot of useful custom methods for you to use. There are also classes like Database and Collection. Scripting API doesn't come with a Database or Collection as of now, so I have added a way for you to easily store and get access to the data. There are a lot more stuff in this API/Lib!

### Built With

- [Scripting API Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/scriptapi/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<br />

## Getting Started

Easy Method

- Download this zip folder and name it to `.mcpack` and import it by double clicking on the folder. This method will only work if you have Minecraft Bedrock Edition on the same device you are doing this action on.

Recommended Method

- Another Method would be to take the zipped folder and unzip/extract it. Take your folder and move it to the folder 'development_behavior_packs', which can be found in a path like `PATH/TO/development_behavior_packs`. This will make your life way easier, while developing this pack. It will update the content inside your game everytime you make any changes to the script. For the changes to apply you must leave and rejoin your world where the pack is applied at.

<br />

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JustSkyDev/Bedrock-API.git
   ```
   <br />

## Usage

<strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>`If you are going to apply any Scripting related scripts to your world, please make a copy of your world before you do so! I'm not responsible if anything goes wrong-`

Create a new world, since Scripting API is still experimental. Make sure in your settings you have `Beta API's` in `Experiments` menu.
I have some examples on how you can use this library. Specifically on custom commands. Type in the game chat `!help` for the list of custom commands or `!help [command name]` to get information on a specific command!
